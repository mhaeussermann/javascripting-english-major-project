# Day 1 of being a JavaScripting English Major

So, okay, I used VS Code instead of Atom, but I think I'll still manage. So what is my goal? I want to create a map similar to what the example shows and also I want to use JavaScript to visualize literary studies projects. While I know HTML and CSS quite well at this point, my knowledge of JavaScript is still lacking and I believe this course will help with that.
