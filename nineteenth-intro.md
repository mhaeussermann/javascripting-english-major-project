## Introduction
This project maps extracted mentions of places/cities from the [Corpus of German-Language Fiction](https://figshare.com/articles/Corpus_of_German-Language_Fiction_txt_/4524680) in 19<sup>th</sup> Century German Literature. 

### Why? 
The 19th Century was a time of remarkable change: as the Industrial Revolution marched on, the world started to feel noticeably smaller. This map shows the range of places imagined in the literature of the time.
