## Introduction
This project maps extracted mentions of places/cities from the [Corpus of German-Language Fiction](https://figshare.com/articles/Corpus_of_German-Language_Fiction_txt_/4524680) in 19<sup>th</sup> Century German Literature. 

### Why? 
The 19th Century was a time of remarkable change. As the Industrial Revolution marched on, the world started to feel noticeably smaller. This feeling was only intensified by the efforts of colonisation by several nations as well as growing waves of immigration from Europe to the Americas. The map makes visible the remarkable range of places imagined in the literature of the time.
