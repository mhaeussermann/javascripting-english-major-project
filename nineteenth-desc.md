## Mapping places in 19th Century German Literature
This project extracted mentions of places from the [Corpus of German-Language Fiction](https://figshare.com/articles/Corpus_of_German-Language_Fiction_txt_/4524680) while specifically focussing on 19th Century works. 

### Why? 
The 19th Century was a time of remarkable change: as the Industrial Revolution marched on, the world started to feel noticeably smaller. This map shows the range of places imagined in the literature of the time.
