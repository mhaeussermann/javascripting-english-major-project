## Europe
As expected from an Corpus of German-language fiction, the bulk of places are located in Western Europe. What is a bit surprising at first is that the place most mentioned is not a German city, but Paris, the capital of France. It is mentioned more than 4500 times in the corpus. Berlin follows close behind with around 4350 mentions. The third big capital of Europe, London, is on the third place.

Other German places mentioned often in the Corpus include Hamburg, Hannover, Leipzig, Dresden and Augsburg. Curiously, Bern is the first Swiss place in terms of how often it is mentioned, and it is mentioned quite a lot more than Basel and Aarau. Furthermore, two Austrian cities - Salzburg and Innsbruck - are in the Top 50.

How to account for the dominant position of Paris in 19th Century German-language fiction? One could assume a measuring error, but this would understate the role that Paris had in 19th Century Europe. The French Revolution of 1789 had a massive impact on the development of Europe, making it a hotspot for the experiment of modernity in the 19th Century: art, literature, music, theatre, architecture and city planning in Europe were influenced by what happened in Paris during the century. That is why Walter Benjamin famously described Paris as the "[Capital of the 19th Century](https://www.textlog.de/benjamin-paris-hauptstadt.html)".
